# JWT Token Flow Update Summary

## Changes Made
Fixed the JWT token flow to match realistic authentication scenarios where tokens are acquired during the flow, not pre-existing on nodes.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Nodes Start Without Tokens**
- All nodes now have `token: null` initially
- Identity Providers (Okta, IdP, Cognito) don't "have" tokens - they ISSUE them
- Services and applications don't have tokens until they receive them from requests

### 2. **Realistic Token Flow in Proposal-1**
The flow now accurately represents the authentication process:

1. **Browser → Umbrella** (no token) - Gets redirected to authenticate
2. **Browser → Okta** - Sends credentials, receives Okta JWT token
3. **Browser → Umbrella** (with Okta token) - Now authenticated
4. **Umbrella → RE-Port App** - Forwards request with Okta token
5. **RE-Port App → IdP** - Exchanges Okta token for IdP token (for RE-Port API)
6. **RE-Port App → RE-Port API** - Uses IdP token
7. **RE-Port API → IdP** - Validates the IdP token
8. Response flows back through the chain

### 3. **Token Exchange Logic**
- Tokens are created dynamically during the flow
- Token exchanges show the transformation from one IdP's token to another
- Validation steps are included in the flow

### 4. **Updated Scenarios**

#### **Proposal-1**
- Complex multi-IdP flow with token exchanges
- Shows Okta → IdP token exchange for API access
- Includes validation steps

#### **Auth Flow Default**
- Standard OAuth/OIDC flow
- Browser starts with no token
- Acquires token from Okta
- Services use and exchange tokens as needed

#### **Microservices**
- Mobile app starts with no token
- Gateway authenticates and issues tokens
- Services exchange tokens for inter-service communication

## Testing the Changes

1. Open the application at http://localhost:5173
2. Select the "Proposal 1" scenario
3. Click "Start" - notice no JWT tokens are visible initially
4. Step through the flow:
   - Steps 1-5: No token (authentication redirect)
   - Step 6: Okta issues JWT token to Browser
   - Step 7+: Token is carried and exchanged as needed
5. Watch the JWT HUD panel - only the packet has tokens
6. Node tokens remain null (as they should)

## Benefits
- **Realistic**: Matches actual authentication flows
- **Educational**: Shows how tokens are acquired and exchanged
- **Accurate**: IdPs issue tokens, services receive them
- **Clear**: Visual representation of token lifecycle
